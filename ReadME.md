100 Days Of Bytewise

## Introduction:

Welcome to 100 Days of Bytewise! This repository tracks my journey through a 100-day machine-learning fellowship with Bytewise Limited. Dive in to find daily updates, key learnings, and projects from day 1 to day 100.

## Key Learning Outcomes:

Through this fellowship, I will gain proficiency in:

- Machine Learning: Algorithms, model evaluation, data preprocessing.
- Deep Learning: Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.


## Tools and Technologies:

Here are the main tools and technologies I am using:

- Languages: Python
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Environments: Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

## How to Contribute:

Contributions are welcome! Hereâ€™s how you can help:
